# RevenueManagement-Pricing

This repository contains the group project work for the Revenue Management and Pricing (SMM641) module as part of the MSc Business Analytics program. The project focuses on developing a comprehensive pricing strategy for "Get-A-Way," a health-conscious start-up entering the UK market with its protein-rich, low-sugar ice cream products. The repository includes the full process of determining optimal pricing through a combined approach of Online Demand Learning and Price Optimization using Consumer Choice.


Project Overview: Step-by-Step Pricing Strategy for "Get-A-Way"
Description: This project presents a step-by-step approach to devising an optimal pricing strategy for "Get-A-Way" as it expands into the UK market. The strategy is implemented in two phases—first, setting initial launch prices through Online Demand Learning, and then refining these prices using insights from Consumer Choice analysis.

Step 1: Online Demand Learning

Objective: To establish the initial pricing for "Get-A-Way's" Standard product line (100ml and 500ml variants) by estimating consumer demand at various price points.
Approach:
Conducted market research to identify four potential price levels for each product variant.
Applied the Penetrative Pricing Strategy to introduce the products at competitive prices aimed at capturing a significant market share.
Used the Thompson Sampling algorithm to dynamically learn and optimize pricing decisions, minimizing regret over time.
Outcome: The analysis identified £1.5 for the 100ml variant and £5 for the 500ml variant as the most effective price points, maximizing consumer demand and positioning "Get-A-Way" strongly for market entry.

Step 2: Price Optimization Using Consumer Choice

Objective: To refine the pricing strategy for the Premium product line by analyzing consumer willingness to pay, using the insights gained from the Standard product launch.
Approach:
Conducted a consumer survey to gather data on willingness to pay for both the Standard and Premium variants.
Simulated market responses using the survey data to estimate consumer surplus and identify optimal price points for the Premium products.
Leveraged the established Standard product prices as a benchmark to set competitive yet profitable prices for the Premium line.
Outcome: The optimal prices for the Premium product line were determined to be £2.1 for the 100ml variant and £6 for the 500ml variant, reflecting a higher willingness to pay due to the enhanced product offering.


Conclusion: By integrating Online Demand Learning with Consumer Choice-based Price Optimization, "Get-A-Way" is well-positioned to successfully penetrate the UK market, capturing both health-conscious consumers and maximizing revenue potential across its product lines.
